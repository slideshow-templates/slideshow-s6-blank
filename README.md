## Try It Yourself - How To Use the Template Pack

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow install s6blank

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using `git`. Issue the commands:

    $ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
    $ git clone https://github.com/slideshow-templates/slideshow-s6-blank.git

To check if the new template got installed, use the `list` command:

    $ slideshow list

Listing something like:

    Installed templates include:
       s6blank.txt (~/.slideshow/templates/s6blank/s6blank.txt)

Now you're ready to use it using the `-t/--template` switch. Example:

    $ slideshow build tutorial -t s6blank

That's it.
